  <p>Is there a strong coorelation between school rankings and income per capita in Southeast states at county level?</p>
  <p>Our hypothesis was that there must be a strong coorelation between school success level and income level of states. However, when we calculate coorelation coefficient between two metrics, r-value is clculated as 0.11, which shows a very low level of coorelation. </p>
